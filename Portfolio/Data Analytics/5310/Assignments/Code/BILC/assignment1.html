    <h1>Assignment 01: Establish Problem Domain</h1>
    <h2>Step 1: Find your Data Domain</h2>

    <p>
        <a href="https://discosweb.esoc.esa.int/">The European Space Agency Database and Information System
            Characterizing Objects in
            Space
        </a>
    </p>
    <h2>Step 2: Why is this Domain Important</h2>
    <p>
        The European Space Agency’s DISCOS database that serves as a single-source reference for over 40000 objects in
        orbit of
        earth. Their primary purpose is bringing together multiple sources for tracking objects in orbit and then using
        that
        data to assist satellite operators in collision avoidance. They even have an API that can be linked into a
        satellite
        operators automated collision avoidance system called DISCOSweb Operations AP. The international space station
        is one
        major user of this data. When there is even a small chance of an object coming with an area around the station
        if it is
        a satellite the owners are contacted and told to make corrections. If it is an uncontrolled object, they
        calculate the
        risk of the object hitting the station and even at a very low risk they will most likely make an obit correction
        to
        avoid the object.
    </p>
    <p>
        Being aware of the objects in space is extremely important from many levels. Like helping companies and
        governments
        avoid colliding their satellites or spacecraft with other objects. Besides losing a satellite or space craft, a
        collision could lead to the loss of all other satellites in orbit. One collision could create so much debris
        that it
        causes a domino effect and a total loss of the ability to send things into orbit. It crucial to have accurate
        and as up
        to date as possible data on every possible object in orbit.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is also important to be able to present this data both for reference and awareness. Governments and companies
        need to
        be able to look up all the info on an object, but they also need to be aware of how big of an issue leaving any
        debris
        in orbit can be.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 3: Planning for a BI/DSS Project based on this Data</h2>
    <p>
        The European Space Agency’s DISCOS database can be accessed via their free API. I’ve already created an account
        and
        verified I could create the API keys. They also have a large amount of documentation available on their website
        that is
        accessible after you register and set up an account. It guides you through using the request package within
        python to
        access the API and pull-down data. Once data is pulled down a dashboard could be made with the data. Some of the
        charts
        that could be included in the dashboard are a bar graph of the different types of objects, how many objects are
        controlled vs, uncontrolled, and a live bar graph of what objects are within a curtain distance of the
        international
        space station. It could also include a animation of the top few hundred objects by size on a live map.
    </p>
    <p>
        It could also include a view with the running list of all tracked objects and filter through the list and select
        specific objects. When viewing specific objects, it should show the other objects within a curtain distance of
        that
        object and rank them from closest to furthest. It could also show a live map of the specific object flying over
        a map.
        Or if live data is not available show its path on a map and list the objects it will come close to.
